##  :raising_hand: Introduction
This repository was created for recruitment task for the Fullstack JavaScript Developer job at Brainhub.  
The main objective is to make a registration form for the event using React, Redux, Node and MongoDB.  
  
At the beginning I would like to point out that the application may seem to be over engineered.  
I tried to create some kind of boilerplate that can be used in any JS client-server application.  
I realize that it could be done in a simpler and faster way but that was not my goal.  
My goal was to show knowledge of various libraries and aspects of client-server architecture.  


## :bookmark_tabs: Goals

*  frontend app should be written in React
*  frontend app should use Redux
*  data from form should be saved in MongoDB
*  data from form should be validated before saving
*  errors should be handled and displayed for the user
*  app must be tested

User interface is based on `bootstrap`.  
The form was created with the help of `redux-form`.  
Form validations implemented with the help of `validator`.  
HTTP requests are supported by async redux actions enabled by `redux-thunk`.  
App snapshots, unit tests, redux tests are powered by `jest`, `enzyme`, `chai`.
