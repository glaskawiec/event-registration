##  :raising_hand: Introduction

At the beginning I would like to point out that the application may seem to be over engineered.
I tried to create some kind of boilerplate used in these types of applications.
I realize that it could be done in a simpler and faster way but that was not my goal.

## Purpose

This repository was created for recruitment task for the Fullstack JavaScript Developer position at Braihub.
The main objective is to make a registration form for the event using React, Redux, Node and MongoDB.

## Goals

*  frontend app should be written in React
*  frontend app should use Redux
*  data from form should be saved in MongoDB
*  data from form should be validated before saving
*  errors should be handled and displayed for the user
*  app must be tested

## :rocket: Server
Backend part of app is powerded by `fastify`.  
Request validation works through `joi`.  
Documentation is generated by `swagger`.  
Logs created by `pino`.  
MongoDB staff handling by `mongoose`.  
Configuration managment by `config`.  
Unit tests powered by `mocha`, `chai`.  
Code linting by `eslint`, `airbnb`.

## :sunrise_over_mountains: Webapp
This part of application is created using `create-react-app`.  
User interface is based on `bootstrap`.  
The form was created with the help of `redux-form`.  
Form validations implemented with the help of `validator`.  
HTTP requests are supported by async redux actions enabled by `redux-thunk`.  
App snapshots, unit tests, redux tests are powered by `jest`, `enzyme`, `chai`.
